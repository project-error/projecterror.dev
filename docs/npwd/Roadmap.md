### Unplanned Features/Won't Support			
These are features the team has no interest in supporting at the current moment. Please do not suggest them as they will be closed/denied.	

- Instagram	App
    - Too similiar already to Twitter and only used for images.	Not worth the dev time.
- Music App
    - DMCA issues with music and potential copyright issues.	
    - This includes any sort of variations to this that are focused on music or copyrighted material.
- Job Whitelisting
    - Heavily dependent on framework integration.
- Default Phone Contacts
    - We plan to handle this with our exposed events for calling/messaging so server owners can do their own things. There won't be any default contacts.
- Radio App
    - Not within the current scope of the phone. Use an actual radio resource.				
- Support For Other Voips		
    - We have standardized [pma-voice](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice) and don't plan to support any other voice resources.		
- Support Ticket
    - Not within the current scope of the phone. Best to use a resource designed for this.
